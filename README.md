## Important Notes

#### Chapter 12 Directory Structure

For Chapter 12, I encountered several issues related to package declarations and directory structure. To understand the reason behind the directory structure changes, the updated directory structure, the solutions implemented, and details about Java packages, please refer to the [Chapter 12 Directory Structure Note](./ch12Issue.md).


## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

* A text editor or IDE of your choice (e.g., Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA)

**Installing Java:**

1. Visit the [official Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
2. Download the latest Java Development Kit (JDK) compatible with your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
3. Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.

**Verifying Java Installation:**

1. Open a terminal window (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).
2. Type `java -version` and press Enter.
3. If Java is installed correctly, you should see the installed Java version information.

**Clone the repository:**

To clone this repository to your local machine, use the following command:
